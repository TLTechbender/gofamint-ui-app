/**
 * ‚ö†Ô∏è  CRITICAL WARNING FOR DEVELOPERS ‚ö†Ô∏è
 *
 * üî• READ THIS BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES üî•
 *
 * There appears to be a potential issue with Sanity's multi-workspace deployment:
 *
 * üö® WORKSPACE ORDER MATTERS:
 *    ‚Ä¢ The FIRST workspace in the defineConfig array becomes the default in the CMS
 *    ‚Ä¢ Currently: PRODUCTION workspace is first (intentional for safety)
 *    ‚Ä¢ DO NOT reorder without understanding the implications
 *
 * üîç OBSERVED BEHAVIOR:
 *    ‚Ä¢ Works FLAWLESSLY in local development environment
 *    ‚Ä¢ Issues ONLY occur in the deployed/hosted Studio interface
 *    ‚Ä¢ Content from non-default workspaces may still exist in the content lake
 *    ‚Ä¢ You just won't be able to access/manage it through the hosted Studio
 *    ‚Ä¢ This could lead to "invisible" content that's hard to manage in production
 *
 * üí° POSSIBLE CAUSES:
 *    ‚Ä¢ Could be a limitation of the free tier
 *    ‚Ä¢ Might be resolved in paid plans with better documentation
 *    ‚Ä¢ Limited community discussions found on this specific issue
 *
 * üìã ACTION ITEMS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPERS:
 *    1. Test workspace switching thoroughly after any config changes
 *    2. Verify content accessibility in both workspaces
 *    3. Document any additional quirks you discover
 *    4. Consider upgrading to paid plan for better support/docs
 *
 * üí¨ If you encounter this issue or find a solution, please update this comment and create a discussion on the github
