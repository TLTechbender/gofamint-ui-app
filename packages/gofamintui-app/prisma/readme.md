⚡ Why Prisma?

I went with Prisma because it lets me move fast without sacrificing reliability:

The TypeScript-first syntax keeps everything strongly typed, so I catch errors early while coding in a language I’m already fully comfortable with.

Instead of writing raw SQL (which I haven’t done in a while), I can express queries in a clean, intuitive API that feels like writing TypeScript.

This means less time fighting database syntax and more time focusing on shipping features quickly.

In short: Prisma helps me stay productive and build at speed while keeping the codebase safe and maintainable (I am mostly building this app myself)
